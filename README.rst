Dask Sphinx Theme
=================

This is the official Sphinx theme for Dask documentation.  It extends the
``sphinx-book-theme`` project, but adds custom styling and a navigation bar to
additional Dask subprojects.

When creating a Dask subproject you can include this theme by changing this
line in your conf.py file

.. code-block:: python

   html_theme = 'dask_sphinx_theme'

And by including ``dask_sphinx_theme`` as a requirement in your documentation
installation.
